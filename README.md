# nasa-astronomy-picture-of-the-day
With this project I used a NASA API and AJAX to make a GET request to their servers for their Astronomy Photo of the Day, for a given date. 

## Tech Used
Some of the technologies used here includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.

## How to Run
Download and open the HTML File in Chrome. 
Choose a date and an image and description should appear. 
Some images are actualy videos and interactive iframes!
